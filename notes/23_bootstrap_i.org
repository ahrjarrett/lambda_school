First class taught by Diandra Ryan-Mas.

This class will be about the Bootstrap framework, but it will also be about frameworks in general.

* Bootstrap Lecture

We need a couple things before we can get started with Bootstrap. First, there is some [[html%20boiler][html boilerplate]] we need to add in.

Next, if we're using any JavaScript functionality, we need to include jQuery, Popper.js, and `bootstrap.min.js` itself.
