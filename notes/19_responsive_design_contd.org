* Code Challenge

Find the first item that occurs an even number of times in an array.

Remember to handle multiple even-occurrence items and return the first one.

Return null if there are no even-occurrence items.

Example usage:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
const onlyEven = evenOccurrence([1, 7, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 6, 4]);
console.log(onlyEven); //  4 
#+END_SRC



#+BEGIN_SRC js

#+END_SRC
